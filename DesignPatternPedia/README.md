# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

## Installation

```bash
 npm i
```

## Local Development

```bash
 npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build and serve

Certain pieces of functionality such as switching locales & searching only works in a production environment. To achieve this you'll need to build and 'deploy' the site locally. To do this run the following commands.

```bash
 npm run build
```

And then to serve the newly created build, simply run.

```bash
 npm run serve
```
