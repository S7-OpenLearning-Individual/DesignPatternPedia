# Welcome to DesignPatternPedia

Ever come across a piece of code and thought, “Why is this written like a Sudoku puzzle?” Congratulations, you’ve found a design pattern (assuming it's not some DIY project...).

This site is your map to the collection of reusable solutions that help developers build reliable and maintainable software across different contexts and technologies.

## So… what even is this?

This documentation is a structured reference for software design patterns — recurring approaches to solving frequently encountered problems in software architecture and object-oriented design.

Each pattern here summarizes a proven solution, the problem it addresses, and the trade-offs involved in applying it.  
Understanding these patterns helps you write code that is consistent, maintainable, and adaptable to change.

## For who is this?

It is primarily aimed at (junior) software developers, but anyone is welcome to take a look! The documents can get a bit technical at times, so a bit of programming background is strongly recommended in order to not get completely lost.

## How does it work?

Patterns are grouped into three core categories, each describing a different perspective on how code can be organized and behave:

- **Creational Patterns** – Deal with object creation and instantiation logic, aiming for flexibility and control over how objects are constructed. [Explore Creational Patterns ›](/docs/creational)

- **Structural Patterns** – Focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures while maintaining efficiency and scalability. [Explore Structural Patterns ›](/docs/structural)

- **Behavioral Patterns** – Describe how objects interact and communicate, defining responsibilities and coordination in software systems. [Explore Behavioral Patterns ›](/docs/behavioral)

Each core group then has it's own pattern page, which describes various aspects of the pattern itself. Subjects such as when to apply it, what it means, a metaphor to really connect it to reality and so forth. Pick a page and start reading from top to bottom.

## Why does this exist?

Software development often faces the same challenges — managing complexity, reducing coupling, and maintaining flexibility. Design patterns offer shared language and principles that developers can rely on to design systems that are easier to extend and understand. The existing website all lack a certain flavour, some are too complex and detailed, some simply do not contain enough precision. I hope to create an overarching experience which actually focusses on helping (junior) developers learn design patterns.
