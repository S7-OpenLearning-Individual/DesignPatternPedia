---

The **Builder** pattern helps to break large, complex constructors and constructive logic into smaller sections. This allows you to build complex objects step by step, whilst using the same construction code. This is particularly useful when an object can be created in multiple ways or requires numerous configurations.

## üß©The problem

Imagine an object or class that is getting increasingly more complex to create. This can include initializing many properties, fields, nested objects and core logic. Such initialization logic is often buried deep within a gigantic constructor with many parameters. This can lead to code that is hard to read, maintain and understand. Additionally, if the object can be created in different ways (e.g., with different configurations), the constructor can become overloaded with multiple parameters, leading to confusion and errors. 

For example, consider a `Computer` class that can be built with various components like CPU, RAM, storage, graphics card, and peripherals. A constructor for such a class could easily become unwieldy and difficult to manage, as it has a lot of parameters you need to manage for each computer. Although they all might need storage, RAM or a graphics card, the specific types and configurations can vary widely per use-case. 

## üõ†Ô∏èSolutions

The builder pattern addresses this problem by separating the construction of a complex object from its representation. It involves creating a `Builder` class that provides methods to configure and create the different parts of the object step by step. The builder class has methods for setting each part of the object, and a final method to construct and return the complete object. The important part is that you are not longer required to call each step individually nor pass each parameter on its own. You only call those steps which are relevant and necessary for your new configuration.

### üé¨ Director

This design pattern is often used with something called a **Director**. The `Director` class is responsible for managing the construction process. It defines the order in which to call the builder's methods, ensuring that the final product is built correctly. The client code interacts with the director instead of the builder directly, allowing for a higher level of abstraction and encapsulation.

### üèõÔ∏èMetaphors

Think of building a house. You have an architect (the Director) who designs the house and a construction team (the Builder) that follows the architect's plans to build it. The architect specifies what kind of house to build, while the construction team handles the actual building process step by step, such as laying the foundation, erecting walls, installing windows, and so on. The end result is a complete house built according to the architect's specifications, but the construction team takes care of the details.

### üí°Real-world examples
Common practical scenarios for applying the Builder pattern include:

- Creating a configuration object with numerous optional parameters.
- Constructing a complex UI component step by step.

## ‚öñÔ∏èPros and Cons

<TwoColumnProsCons 
  pros={["Allows you to construct complex objects step by step", "Improves code readability and maintainability", "Enables different representations of the same construction process","Works with the Single Responsibility Principle by separating construction logic from business logic"]}
  cons={["Increases complexity of the code due to the increased number of classes required to construct",]}
/>


## üîçApplicability

<Applicability items={[
  {
    situation: "Use when you want to be able to create different representations of a complex object, using the same construction process",
    context: "For example, building different type of cars (SUV, Sedan, Truck) using the same steps but different configurations."
  },
]} />

## üß≠Implementation Plan

To implement a Builder manually:

1. Gather a clear list of instructions, configurations and steps required to build the complex object.
2. Declare these steps in a builder interface.
3. Create a concrete builder for each configuration or representation of the object.
4. Optionally, create a Director class to manage the construction process.
5. Use the builder (and director if applicable) in your client code to create the complex object step by step.
6. Fetch the final object from the builder (or director if used and the interfaces match) once all necessary steps are completed.

## üîóRelations to other patterns
- The Builder pattern is often used in conjunction with the [Factory Method](/docs/Creational/factory-method) pattern, where the factory method creates a builder instance.
- You can combine [Builder](/docs/Creational/builder) with [Bridge](/docs/Structural/bridge): the director class plays the role of the abstraction, while different builders act as implementations.
- [Abstract Factories](/docs/Creational/abstract-factory), [Builders](/docs/Creational/builder), and [Prototype](/docs/Creational/prototype) can be implemented as [Singleton](/docs/Creational/singleton).
